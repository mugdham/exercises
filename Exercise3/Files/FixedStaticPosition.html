			<h2 class="heading">Static Positioning</h2>
			HTML elements are positioned static by default. A static positioned element is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
			Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
			This is the default for every single page element. Different elements don't have different default values for positioning, they all start out as static. Static doesn't mean much, it just means that the element will flow into the page as it normally would.

			<h2 class="heading">Fixed Positioning</h2>
			An element with fixed position is positioned relative to the browser window.
			It will not move even if the window is scrolled:Fixed positioned elements are removed from the normal flow. The document and other elements behave like the fixed positioned element does not exist.
			Fixed positioned elements can overlap other elements.
			A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself. The viewport doesn't change when the window is scrolled, so a fixed positioned element will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled.
